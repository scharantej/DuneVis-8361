<h1>About Dune: Imperium</h1>
<p>
Dune: Imperium is a deck-building and worker-placement game set in the Dune universe. In the game, players take on the roles of noble families vying for control of the planet Arrakis, the only known source of the valuable spice melange.
</p>
<p>
Players will use their cards to place workers on different locations on Arrakis, allowing them to collect resources, build armies, and develop technologies. The game is played over several rounds, with each round representing a year in the Dune timeline.
</p>
<p>
The game ends when one player has achieved a certain number of victory points, or when the end of the game is triggered by a special event.
