### Flask Application Design

**HTML Files:**

1. **home.html (Homepage):**
   - Display high-quality images of game components, artwork, and thematic elements, captivating potential players
   - Include engaging animations that showcase the game's features, without being overly distracting
   - Feature concise, captivating text that highlights the game's appeal
   - Use a color scheme inspired by the Dune universe, incorporating deep blues, rich oranges, and sandy neutrals

**Routes:**

1. **home():**
   - Defines the route for the homepage
   - Renders the home.html template, which displays the landing page content

2. **about():** (Optional)
   - Defines the route for an optional "About the Game" page
   - Provides additional information about the game's mechanics, lore, and creators

3. **buy_now():** (Optional)
   - Defines the route for a "Buy Now" button
   - Redirects users to a platform where they can purchase the game

4. **contact():** (Optional)
   - Defines the route for a contact form
   - Allows users to submit inquiries or provide feedback

**Implementation:**

- The Flask application should use Bootstrap as the frontend framework.
- All HTML files and CSS should be served from a static folder to avoid cluttering the application code. (e.g., `static/css/styles.css` and `static/home.html`)
- Animations should be implemented using CSS or JavaScript, ensuring smooth transitions and minimal impact on performance.
- Use external image hosting services (e.g., Cloudinary, Imgur) to host the game images and artwork.
- Employ responsive design to ensure the landing page adapts well to different screen sizes.
